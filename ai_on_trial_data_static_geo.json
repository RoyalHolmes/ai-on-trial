Further, Tesla repeatedly warned against misuse of the features, which was industry practice.

The Court finds that the evidence at trial establishes CrimSAFE \n\nmatched applicants with data, but it was the housing provider—not CrimSAFE—\nthat decided whether an applicant is qualified for housing.  The housing provider \ncontrols the disqualification process by making four key decisions in how it uses \nCrimSAFE: (1) who within their organization receives criminal reports, (2) what \ncriminal records are relevant for their decision, (3) how to review the records, and \n(4) when to accept an applicant.",

The complainant, who was a patient of the University, argued Google had enough data points to re-identify the patients (based on the records and the geolocation from Google apps), in a breach of contract and medical confidentiality. The case was dismissed and the decision was affirmed on appeal, as the Seventh Circuit understood it lacked plausibility.",
    "excerpt": "\"We start with the backward-looking form of injury. Cru-\ncially, Dinerstein does not allege that Google has already\nused the disclosed patient records to discern his identity.\nInstead he focuses on the conduct of the University, arguing\nthat the record transfer was itself an actionable invasion of\nhis medical privacy. This is so, Dinerstein asserts, regardless\nof whether Google ever actually identifies him. (…) Put differently, just because some\nde-identification processes might be deficient, we cannot\nassume that the University’s process was necessarily so. To\nthe contrary, the complaint acknowledges that the chal-\nlenged record transfer occurred pursuant to the Data Use\nAgreement, which states that “the majority of [patient]\nidentifiers will be removed,” leaving only “actual dates of\n[medical] service and events.” Dinerstein’s allegations of\ninsufficient anonymization therefore do not cross the plausi-\nbility threshold.

    "excerpt": "\"As confirmed at oral argument, plaintiffs do not contend that there is an express contract\nprovision requiring defendants to post plaintiffs’ videos on YouTube. Nor do plaintiffs deny that\ndefendants have broad discretion in deciding whether to remove, restrict, or demonetize content on\nYouTube. See Dkt. No. 136 (Mar. 21, 2023 Tr. at 26:20-27:4; 28:14-22; 38:1-9). Rather, plaintiffs claim that defendants’ various “Form Agreements, including the TOS [Terms of Service] Rules, Google’s Privacy Policy, and related agreement(s)” require defendants to apply their rules\nand policies equally to everyone. (…) Plaintiffs acknowledge that there is no express contractual provision that prohibits\ndefendants from discriminating against plaintiffs based on their sexual or gender orientation or\nviewpoints. See Dkt. No. 136 (Mar. 21, 2023 Tr. at 21:8-11). They nonetheless maintain that\nYouTube’s Community Guidelines, as a whole, are part of the various Terms of Service between\nplaintiffs and YouTube, and that the above-quoted provision, in particular, supports an implied\ncovenant that defendants will only remove, restrict, or demonetize plaintiffs’ videos based on the\nvideos’ content in the same manner they remove, restrict, or demonetize the videos of other\nYouTube users, and not based on the identities of the persons who created or posted that content. (…)Unlike the statement in Block, the subject language from YouTube’s Community\nGuidelines (i.e., that the Guidelines are “appl[ied]. . . to everyone equally—regardless of the\nsubject or the creator’s background, political viewpoint, position, or affiliation”) is more than a\nmere description of how YouTube works. Rather, the statement reasonably may be construed as\nan affirmative representation about how defendants apply and enforce the Guidelines—namely,\nthat the Guidelines will be applied without regard to a “creator’s background, political viewpoint,\nposition, or affiliation.” (…)However, defendants persuasively argue that the cited Community Guidelines cannot\nplausibly be the basis for plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim, asserting that the subject text about\napplying those rules to “everyone equally” was not added to the Community Guidelines until\nsometime in 2021, years after the moderation decisions alleged in plaintiffs’ complaint.6”",

",
    "excerpt": "\"1. The plaintiffs allege that the “LLaMA language models are themselves infringing\nderivative works” because the “models cannot function without the expressive information\nextracted” from the plaintiffs’ books. This is nonsensical. A derivative work is “a work based\nupon one or more preexisting works” in any “form in which a work may be recast, transformed,\nor adapted.\n” 17 U.S.C. § 101. There is no way to understand the LLaMA models themselves as a\nrecasting or adaptation of any of the plaintiffs’ books. 2. Another theory is that “every output of the LLaMA language models is an infringing\nderivative work,” and that because third-party users initiate queries of LLaMA, “every output\nfrom the LLaMA language models constitutes an act of vicarious copyright infringement.” But\nthe complaint offers no allegation of the contents of any output, let alone of one that could be understood as recasting, transforming, or adapting the plaintiffs’ books. Without any plausible\nallegation of an infringing output, there can be no vicarious infringement. See Perfect 10, Inc. v.\namazon.com, Inc., 508 F.3d 1146, 1169 (9th Cir. 2007).\nThe plaintiffs are wrong to say that, because their books were duplicated in full as part of\nthe LLaMA training process, they do not need to allege any similarity between LLaMA outputs\nand their books to maintain a claim based on derivative infringement. To prevail on a theory that\nLLaMA’s outputs constitute derivative infringement, the plaintiffs would indeed need to allege\nand ultimately prove that the outputs “incorporate in some form a portion of” the plaintiffs’\nbooks.

    "summary": "Complainants allege Minnessota Statute § 609.771 violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments insofar as it criminalizes the dissemination of deepfakes related to the elections. This is due to the chilling effects the law might have on political speech, such as parody and satirical content. Injunctive relief was denied. To one of the complainants, he was considered as lacking standing because his contents were labeled as parody, and thus he had not posted content that is defined by the law as being considered a deepfake. To the other plaintiff, although standing was recognized, The Court considered she did not prove she suffered irreparable harm and, thus, was not entitled to injunctive relief.",
    "excerpt": "\"First, the Court concludes that Minn. Stat. § 609.771 does not penalize pure parody\nor satire. Constitutionally speaking, parody is that which “cannot ‘reasonably [be]\ninterpreted as stating actual facts’ about an individual.\n” Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.,\n497 U.S. 1, 20 (1990) (quoting Hustler Mag., Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 50 (1988))\n(alteration in original). But the statute at issue here only proscribes a deepfake insofar as\nit “is so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it depicts speech or conduct of an\nindividual who did not in fact engage in such speech or conduct.” Minn. Stat. § 609.771,\nsubd. 1(c)(1). The statute’s definition of a deepfake thus categorically excludes\nconstitutional parody from its sweep. If the speech in question “cannot reasonably be\ninterpreted as stating actual facts about an individual,” then it cannot be a deepfake under\nthe statute.”",

    "year": 2016,
    "issue": "Criminal justice",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The complainant alleges the use of COMPAS to assess his recidivism risk was used to deny him probation and that the proprietary nature of the system violated his due process rights. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the use of COMPAS did not violate his due process rights because the judges could be adequately cautioned that the system is not transparent and there has been evidence that it shows bias to minorities; that the COMPAS assessment was only one of the factors considered; and that gender is used as a factor to promote accuracy, not to discriminate, and the complainant did not carry forward an equal protection claim.",
    "excerpt": "\" ¶8 Ultimately, we conclude that if used properly,\nobserving the limitations and cautions set forth herein, a\ncircuit court's consideration of a COMPAS risk assessment at\nsentencing does not violate a defendant's right to due process.\n¶9 We determine that because the circuit court explained\nthat its consideration of the COMPAS risk scores was supported\nby other independent factors, its use was not determinative in\ndeciding whether Loomis could be supervised safely and\neffectively in the community. Therefore, the circuit court did\nnot erroneously exercise its discretion. We further conclude\nthat the circuit court's consideration of the read-in charges\nwas not an erroneous exercise of discretion because it employed\nrecognized legal standards. (…) However, Loomis asserts that even if statistical\ngeneralizations based on gender are accurate, they are not\nnecessarily constitutional. He cites to Craig v. Boren, 429\nU.S. 190, 208-210 (1976), a case where the United States Supreme\nCourt concluded that an Oklahoma law that prohibited the sale of\n3.2% beer to men under the age 21 and to women under the age of\n18 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Court explained that although state officials\noffered sociological or empirical justifications for the gender-\nbased difference in the law, \"the principles embodied in the\nEqual Protection Clause are not to be rendered inapplicable by\nstatistically measured but loose-fitting generalities concerning\nthe drinking tendencies of aggregate groups.\" Id. at 208-09.\n¶80 Notably, however, Loomis does not bring an equal\nprotection challenge in this case. Thus, we address whether\nLoomis's constitutional due process right not to be sentenced on\nthe basis of gender is violated if a circuit court considers a\nCOMPAS risk assessment at sentencing.

Compl. at ¶ 43].

    "summary": "The complainants allege the Twitter platform aided and abetted ISIS as it allowed them to spread content and recruit terrorists. The district court granted the motion to dismiss due to lack of causation and due to the lack of substantial assistance. The Ninth Circuit reversed, considering that media had covered ISIS social media activities and thus the defendant was generally aware of it, and that the defendants had failed to take steps to prevent ISIS activities, providing an essential platform to its growth. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, and considered there weren’t enough elements to conclude Twitter aided and abetted ISIS. ",
    "excerpt": "\"(c) Plaintiffs have satisfied Halberstam’s first two elements by al-\nleging both that ISIS committed a wrong and that defendants knew\nthey were playing some sort of role in ISIS’ enterprise. But plaintiffs’\nallegations do not show that defendants gave such knowing and sub-\nstantial assistance to ISIS that they culpably participated in the Reina\nattack. Pp. 21–30. (…) None of plaintiffs’ allegations suggest that defendants culpably “as-\nsociate[d themselves] with” the Reina attack, “participate[d] in it as\nsomething that [they] wishe[d] to bring about,” or sought “by [their]\naction to make it succeed.” Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Defendants’ mere creation of their media\nplatforms is no more culpable than the creation of email, cell phones,\nor the internet generally. And defendants’ recommendation algo-\nrithms are merely part of the infrastructure through which all the con-\ntent on their platforms is filtered. Moreover, the algorithms have been presented as agnostic as to the nature of the content. At bottom, the\nallegations here rest less on affirmative misconduct and more on pas-\nsive nonfeasance. To impose aiding-and-abetting liability for passive\nnonfeasance, plaintiffs must make a strong showing of assistance and\nscienter. Plaintiffs fail to do so. (…) plaintiffs identify no duty that would require defendants or other com-\nmunication-providing services to terminate customers after discover-\ning that the customers were using the service for illicit ends. Even if\nsuch a duty existed in this case, it would not transform defendants’\ndistant inaction into knowing and substantial assistance that could\nestablish aiding and abetting the Reina attack. And the expansive\nscope of plaintiffs’ claims would necessarily hold defendants liable as\nhaving aided and abetted each and every ISIS terrorist act committed\nanywhere in the world. The allegations plaintiffs make here are not\nthe type of pervasive, systemic, and culpable assistance to a series of\nterrorist activities that could be described as aiding and abetting each\nterrorist act by ISIS.”",

Employers cannot escape liability for\ndiscrimination by delegating their traditional functions, like hiring, to a third party. (…) The FAC plausibly alleges that Workday’s customers delegate traditional hiring\nfunctions, including rejecting applicants, to the algorithmic decision-making tools provided by\nWorkday. According to the FAC, Workday’s software is not simply implementing in a rote way\nthe criteria that employers set forth, but is instead participating in the decision-making process\nby recommending some candidates to move forward and rejecting others.

    "year": 2023,
    "issue": "Intellectual property",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The complainant alleges ROSS Intelligence compiled Westlaw cases and proprietary headnotes to develop a ML-based legal research platform. In 2025, the Court held that the headnotes were original, extracting particular sections of the decisions and phrasing it in their own words, granting summary judgement for a subset of them. The reproduction by ROSS Intelligence was not considered as fair use: the character of the use was commercial and its purpose was to develop a product in the same market as Westlaw, so it was not considered transformative.  ",
    "excerpt": "\"First, the headnotes are a compilation. “Factual compilations” are original if the\ncompiler makes “choices as to selection and arrangement” using “a minimal degree of\ncreativity.” Feist, 499 U.S. at 348. Thomson Reuters’s selection and arrangement of\nits headnotes easily clears that low bar.\nMore than that, each headnote is an individual, copyrightable work. That became\nclear to me once I analogized the lawyer’s editorial judgment to that of a sculptor. A\nblock of raw marble, like a judicial opinion, is not copyrightable. Yet a sculptor creates\na sculpture by choosing what to cut away and what to leave in place. That sculpture\nis copyrightable. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(5). So too, even a headnote taken verbatim from\nan opinion is a carefully chosen fraction of the whole. Identifying which words matter\nand chiseling away the surrounding mass expresses the editor’s idea about what the\nimportant point of law from the opinion is. (…) My prior opinion wrongly concluded that I had to send this factor to a jury. 694 F.\nSupp. 3d at 483–84. I based that conclusion on Sony and Sega. Since then, I have\nrealized that the intermediate-copying cases (1) are computer-programming copying\ncases; and (2) depend in part on the need to copy to reach the underlying ideas. Nei-\nther is true here. Because of that, this case fits more neatly into the newer framework\nadvanced by Warhol. I thus look to the broad purpose and character of Ross’s use.\nRoss took the headnotes to make it easier to develop a competing legal research tool.\nSo Ross’s use is not transformative. Because the AI landscape is changing rapidly, I\nnote for readers that only non-generative AI is before me today.”",

Preliminary injunction was granted, then a protective order, which stipulated ICE had to file a report about each individual detained without a bond. The case was finally settled. ",
    "excerpt": "\"Next, the key question: Has ICE indeed adopted the No-Release Policy? As noted supra, Plaintiffs argue, and Defendants do not dispute, that 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and its implementing regulations require ICE officials to make an individualized custody determination. See Pl. PI Mem. at 20-22. Plaintiffs argue that the data analyzed and reviewed in the Hausman Declaration show that ICE has been applying a No-Release Policy. (…) Plaintiffs argue that the numbers speak for themselves and I agree. One need not fix the precise point between 2015 and 2017 that a change took place to see plainly that a change, of considerable magnitude, took place. Per the data, ICE went from releasing (on bond or recognizance) upwards of 30% of alien arrestees to releasing around 2%. The percentage of arrestees released in 2013 and 2014 was around 40%; in 2018 and 2019, between 1% and 2%. The comparisons are striking. (…) I find that Plaintiffs have demonstrated, at this stage, that they are likely to succeed in proving the existence of the No-Release Policy. As Defendants acknowledge, a No-Release Policy is inconsistent with the INA and regulations passed thereunder, at least without notice-and-comment rule making. Plaintiffs have thus shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. As the Court has already found that Plaintiffs have shown they will suffer irreparable harm without relief and that the equities tilt in Plaintiffs’ favor, injunctive relief is called for here.”",

    "summary": "The complainants allege Baidu censored their pro-democracy content in the US, violating their First Amendment rights. The Court considered that the search engine had the autonomy to control which content it would show in its platform, given it had editorial judgement, granting the motion to dismiss. ",
    "excerpt": "\"In light of those principles, there is a strong argument to be made that the First Amendment fully immunizes search-engine results from most, if not all, kinds of civil liability and government regulation. See, e.g., Benjamin, supra, at 1458-72; Volokh & Falk, supra, at 884-92. The central purpose of a search engine is to retrieve relevant information from the vast universe of data on the Internet and to organize it in a way that would be most helpful to the searcher. In doing so, search engines inevitably make editorial judgments about what information (or kinds of information) to include in the results and how and where to display that information (for example, on the first page of the search results or later). (…) Here, the very theory of Plaintiffs' claims is that Baidu exercises editorial control over its search results on certain political topics — namely, by disfavoring expression concerning \"the Democracy movement in China\" and related subjects. (Compl. ¶ 22). In other words, Plaintiffs do not — and, in light of their own allegations, cannot — make any argument that Baidu is merely an \"infrastructure or platform that delivers content\" in a neutral way. Bracha & Pasquale, supra, at 1192-97 (arguing that because \"search engines do not function as publishers or editors of the content to which they channel users,\" their results should not be treated as speech covered by the First Amendment).[5] Instead, they seek to hold Baidu liable for, and thus punish Baidu for, a conscious decision to design its search-engine algorithms to favor certain expression on core political subjects over other expression on those same political subjects.[6] To allow such a suit to proceed would plainly \"violate[] the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.\" Hurley, 515 U.S. at 573; see also, e.g., Agency for Intl Dev. v.

    "summary": "The Belgium Constitutional Court had posed several questions with regards to the GDPR and the use of passengers data to prevent and investigate terrorism and criminality (PNR Directive). The Court understood national law could be interpreted in conformity with EU law. One of the factors it remarked as protecting fundamental rights from unwarranted intrusion was that the criteria with regards to which the PNR data is processed are pre-determined. This would preclude the use of AI. It also noted that the profiles used in the algorithmic decision-making don’t need to be public so the process can be considered transparent, but that the algorithmic decision-making must be identifiable.",
    "excerpt": "\"Thirdly, it emerges both from the wording of Article 6(3)(b) of the PNR Directive and from\nthe system of safeguards surrounding the automated processing of PNR data under the PNR\nDirective that the algorithms used for the analysis provided for in that provision must function\ntransparently, and that the result of their application must be traceable. That requirement of\ntransparency clearly does not mean that the ‘profiles’ used must be made public. It does in\ncontrast require the algorithmic decision-making to be identifiable. On the one hand, the\nrequirement that the criteria on the basis of which that analysis is carried out must be\n‘pre-determined’ means that they must not be modifiable without human intervention and,\ntherefore, precludes the use of ‘machine learning’ artificial intelligence technology,225 which,\nwhilst it may be more precise, is difficult to interpret, even for the operators who carried out the\nautomated processing.226 On the other hand, if it is to be effective, the safeguard set out in\nArticle 6(5) and (6) of the PNR Directive, according to which any positive match resulting from\nthe automated processing of PNR data under Article 6(2)(a) must be individually reviewed by\nnon-automated means, requires – in relation to the analysis under Article 6(3)(b) of the PNR Directive – that it must be possible to understand why the program arrived at that match, which\ncannot be guaranteed when, for example, self-learning systems are used. The same is true as\nregards monitoring the lawfulness of the analysis – including in relation to the fact that the\nresults obtained must be non-discriminatory, which is the responsibility of the data protection\nofficer and the national supervisory authority, under Article 6(7) and Article 15(3)(b) of the PNR\nDirective respectively.

Under the EPC the\ndesignated inventor has to be a person with legal\ncapacity. This is not merely an assumption on which the\nEPC was drafted. It is the ordinary meaning of the term\ninventor (see, for instance, Oxford Dictionary of\nEnglish: “a person who invented a particular process or\ndevice or who invents things as an occupation”; Collins\nDictionary of the English language: “a person who\ninvents, esp. as a profession”).\nThere is no reason to assume that the EPC uses the term\nin a special way departing from its ordinary meaning.\nWhen a provision of the EPC 2000 refers to or includes\nthe inventor(s), it uses the terms person or legal\npredecessor (e.g., Article 60(2) EPC or Article 55(1)\nEPC). So did the EPC 1973 in the corresponding legal\nprovisions. Article 60(1) EPC vests the rights to the\nEuropean patent in the inventor; thus, it postulates a\nperson with legal capacity.

Restricting itself to the interpretation of the 1977 Act, the Court considered hat an inventor had to be a natural person.",
    "excerpt": "\"In my judgment, the position taken by the Comptroller on this issue is entirely\ncorrect. The structure and content of sections 7 and 13 of the Act, on their own and in\nthe context of the Act as a whole, permit only one interpretation: an inventor within the\nmeaning of the 1977 Act must be a natural person, and DABUS is not a person at all, let\nalone a natural person: it is a machine and on the factual assumption underpinning these\nproceedings, created or generated the technical advances disclosed in the applications\non its own.

    "excerpt": "\"We acknowledge that providing fictitious cases in reasonable excuse tax appeals is likely to have less impact on the outcome than in many other types of litigation, both because the law on reasonable excuse is well-settled, and because the task of a Tribunal is to consider how that law applies to the particular facts of each appellant’s case. But that does not mean that citing invented judgments is harmless. It causes the Tribunal and HMRC to waste time and public money, and this reduces the resources available to progress the cases of other court users who are waiting for their appeals to be determined. As Judge Kastel said, the practice also “promotes cynicism” about judicial precedents, and this is important, because the use of precedent is “a cornerstone of our legal system” and “an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases”, as Lord Bingham’s said in Kay v LB of Lambeth [2006] UKHL 10 at [42]. Although FTT judgments are not binding on other Tribunals, they nevertheless “constitute persuasive authorities which would be expected to be followed” by later Tribunals considering similar fact patterns, see Ardmore Construction Limited v HMRC [2014] UKFTT 453 at [19].\n“",

    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The case concerns the patentability of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based system developed by Emotional Perception AI Ltd (EPL), which provides media recommendations based on human emotional perception. The key legal question was whether the invention was excluded from patentability under Section 1(2) of the UK Patents Act 1977, which excludes computer programs “as such.”\n\nThe UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) rejected the patent application, arguing that the ANN system was merely a computer program. The High Court (Sir Anthony Mann J) overturned this decision, ruling that the exclusion did not apply because the system was not a computer program as such and involved a technical effect. The Comptroller-General of Patents appealed. The Court of Appeal held that an ANN qualifies as a computer program because its weights and biases function as a set of instructions for processing information, regardless of whether implemented in hardware or software. Moreover, The Court of Appeal found that the ultimate function of the system (i.e., making subjective media recommendations) is not a technical effect under patent law. Instead, it relates to aesthetic preferences, making it excluded subject matter.",

    "finalDecision": NaN,
    "summary": "This case concerns the legality and implications of Article 17 of Directive 2019/790, particularly its requirement for online content-sharing service providers to take measures to prevent copyright infringement. The core debate revolves around whether the directive, in practice, imposes an obligation on service providers to implement automatic content recognition (ACR) tools—such as digital fingerprinting—to filter and block copyrighted content before it is uploaded.\n\nThe Opinion acknowledges that while the final version of the Directive does not explicitly require ACR tools, it effectively mandates their use through the conditions for exemption from liability. To avoid liability, providers must demonstrate they have made “best efforts” to prevent the upload of infringing content in accordance with “high industry standards.” Given the scale of content uploaded to such platforms, manual review is impractical, leaving automated filtering as the only feasible solution. The Opinion concludes that Article 17 of Directive 2019/790 can respect freedom of expression, but only if implemented with sufficient safeguards to prevent overblocking of lawful content. The key argument is that while the directive imposes significant restrictions on user expression by requiring proactive content filtering, it does not automatically violate freedom of expression because it includes safeguards—particularly the recognition of user rights under copyright exceptions and the requirement for a complaint and redress mechanism.",
    "excerpt": "\"149. In view of the risks of ‘over-blocking’ described in the subsection above, a liability regime such as that resulting from the contested provisions must, in my view, be accompanied by sufficient safeguards to minimise those risks and, therefore, ensure that the extent of the interference with freedom of expression is precisely circumscribed. (187) Generally speaking, any kind of delegation, by public authorities, of the review of online legality to intermediary providers, (188) in the form of monitoring obligations which are imposed directly or indirectly on those intermediaries, must be accompanied by such safeguards.\n(…) 158. The defendants and the interveners have rightly pointed out that one of the main safeguards intended to limit the risk of sharing service providers preventing, pursuant to the contested provisions, the availability on their services of content which lawfully reproduces the works and other protected subject matter identified by rightholders is contained in Article 17(7) of Directive 2019/790.\n159. First, the first subparagraph of that paragraph provides that ‘the cooperation between … sharing service providers and rightholders (194) shall not result in the prevention of the availability of works or other subject matter uploaded by users, which do not infringe copyright and related rights, including where such works or other subject matter are covered by an exception or limitation’. (195)\n160. Secondly, in accordance with the second subparagraph of that paragraph, Member States must ensure that users are able to rely on the exceptions and limitations relating to (a) quotation, criticism and review and (b) use for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche (196) when they upload content to sharing services.\n“",

    "year": 2023,
    "issue": "Criminal justice",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that sections of laws in Hesse and Hamburg authorizing automated data analysis by police are unconstitutional due to their lack of clear safeguards against excessive interference with personal rights, particularly with informational self-determination. \tThe Court emphasized that automated data analysis produces new intelligence that can significantly intrude on personal privacy. Moreover, the use of AI-driven predictive policing tools (e.g., detecting statistical anomalies) was left unrestricted, raising concerns about potential discrimination and wrongful targeting.\n",
    "excerpt": "\"The use of self-learning systems – i.e. artificial intelligence or AI – can interfere with fundamental rights in a particularly intrusive manner depending on the particular use in question. The advantages of such systems – as well as the specific dangers they pose – lie in the fact that they do not simply apply the criminologically sound profiles used by individual police officers, but rather that they automatically refine these profiles, or in some cases even create entirely new ones, and then continue to combine them during further stages of the analysis. (…) This enables particularly far-reaching insights and assumptions to be generated about a person. The verification of such information can be difficult in practice because, over the course of the machine learning process, complex algorithmic systems can increasingly detach themselves from the human programming that created them, with the machine learning process and the results generated becoming increasingly difficult to scrutinise (cf. CJEU, Judgment of 21 June 2021, Ligue des droits humains , C-817/19, ECLI:EU:C:2022:491, para. 195). State oversight over the technology could then be rendered impossible. Furthermore, if software from private actors or foreign states is deployed, there is a risk that third parties could manipulate or gain access to data in undetected ways ([...]). Another specific challenge is to prevent the emergence and application of algorithmic discrimination. Self-learning systems may only be used in police work if special procedural safeguards are in place to ensure that sufficient levels of protection are guaranteed despite the reduced possibilities for exercising scrutiny.”",

    "summary": "The French Constitutional Council upheld most provisions of the law related to surveillance related to the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The court recognized that the use of algorithmic video surveillance, including AI processing of images from public cameras and drones, served the constitutional objective of preventing threats to public order. However, it acknowledged concerns about the technology’s impact on fundamental rights. In approving the experiment with AI-driven video analysis, the court insisted that such systems remain under strict human supervision. The judges maintained that these provisions do not in themselves violate privacy rights, but their implementation must include fundamental rights safeguards, and any extension beyond the experimental period could ensue a reassessment of their constitutional implications.",
    "excerpt": "\"To meet the objective of constitutional value of preventing violations of public order, the legislator may authorize the algorithmic processing of images collected by means of a video protection system or cameras installed on aircraft. Although such processing has neither the object nor the effect of modifying the conditions under which these images are collected, it nevertheless carries out a systematic and automated analysis of these images that may significantly increase the number and accuracy of the information that can be extracted from them. Therefore, the implementation of such monitoring systems must be accompanied by special safeguards to safeguard the right to respect for privacy.”",

    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The Conseil d’État, acting as an urgent administrative judge, overturned a lower court ruling that had ordered the Cœur Côte Fleurie intermunicipal authority to stop using the BriefCam software and erase all related data, except for a single copy placed under the control of the CNIL (French Data Protection Authority).\n\nThe Conseil d’État found that the lower court had wrongly issued an emergency injunction without sufficient justification. It held that the mere presence of AI-powered video analytics functionalities, such as object and movement recognition, did not in itself constitute an urgent threat to fundamental rights. The ruling emphasized that while the software had capabilities for facial recognition, the intermunicipal authority had not activated them, and no evidence showed they had been used. Furthermore, the court noted that the AI-assisted surveillance was only applied to pre-recorded footage, not for real-time tracking or automated decision-making.\nGiven that CNIL was already investigating the use of AI in public surveillance, the Conseil d’État ruled that there was no immediate need for additional measures.

On the other hand, if it is true that the software in question includes, in the \"Review\" module, image analysis functionality, in particular by applying filters, for example by sex, size or type of clothing, or analysis of movement behavior, the community of municipalities indicates that the software is not used to ensure, through the implementation of algorithmic processing, an automated monitoring of people or detect events and trigger alerts in real time, the \"Responde\" module with which the software can be equipped not being available. Deployed in the intercommunality for several years, for a limited number of cameras, it appears, in the state of the investigation, that this system, as it is calibrated and can reasonably be mobilized, is only used for a deferred proofreading, over a limited area and time, of the images collected by the cameras concerned, in particular for the purpose of vehicle analysis and a search for license plates, for the needs of an investigation and participates in the smooth running of the investigation by reducing the times for reading and exploitation of these images.\n“",

    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The Conseil d’État rejected all challenges against the DataJust decree, which authorized an automated system to analyze court decisions for assessing compensation in bodily injury cases.\nThe court ruled that the decree complied with GDPR and French data protection laws, serving a legitimate public interest by improving legal predictability. It emphasized that the system was experimental, limited to two years, and did not affect judicial decision-making as it was not to be made available to magistrates oe parties.\nPrivacy concerns were dismissed, citing pseudonymization, a legitimate purpose, and that individual notification of data subjects was deemed impractical.\n",
    "excerpt": "\"Secondly, the applicants dispute the purposes of this processing on the grounds that the algorithm it aims to develop would be both contrary to the principles of individualization and full compensation for damage, unnecessary because of the existence of other tools having the same purpose, and biased because the processing does not take into account amicable compensation and the evolution of the law. However, it is clear from the documents in the file that the purpose of the processing authorized by the contested decree is to develop an algorithm for the development of an indicative reference framework for compensation for personal injury intended to be used to assess these injuries in the context of both the amicable and judicial settlement of disputes. It thus tends to ensure easier access to the case law on compensation for personal injury in order to guarantee the accessibility and predictability of the law. Moreover, and at this stage, this processing, the duration of which is reduced to two years, is limited to the development phase of an artificial intelligence tool, is only experimental and is not intended, at this stage, to be made available to magistrates or parties. It follows that the plea alleging that the purposes pursued by the processing are not legitimate must be dismissed.”\n",

    "summary": "This case concerns whether the CHSCT (Comité d’Hygiène, de Sécurité et des Conditions de Travail) had the right to appoint an expert to assess the impact of IBM Watson, an AI tool introduced by Crédit Mutuel, on employees’ working conditions. Under Article L. 4614-12 of the French Labor Code, the CHSCT can call for expert evaluations when a significant modification affects employees’ health, safety, or working conditions. The CHSCT argued that Watson fundamentally changed working conditions, carrying itself the potential for redistribution of an employee activities, justifying an expert review. Crédit Mutuel contested this, claiming that Watson merely optimized email processing and workflow without altering core job functions.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Crédit Mutuel, finding that Watson only facilitated certain tasks, such as sorting emails and suggesting responses, rather than redefining roles or work conditions in a way that would trigger CHSCT oversight.",
    "excerpt": "\"But having noted that the introduction of the Watson computer program will help account managers process the abundant emails they receive either by redirecting them from the keywords they contain to the counter where they can be directly processed because of the skills previously defined by the head of agency in view of the request, or by treating them in order of priority due to the urgency they present and which will be reported to them, or even by responding to them in an appropriate way by proposing a declination of situations to unforgetably adapt the answer to the question posed, that it therefore directly translates into minor consequences in the direct working conditions of employees whose tasks will be facilitated, the president of the high court, who was not obliged to follow the parties in the detail of their argument, was able to deduce that the existence of an important project modifying the health and safety conditions or the working conditions of employees was not demonstrated and rightly annulled the deliberation of the CHSCT apomining an expert; that the plea is not well-founded;\n“",

    "excerpt": "\"Likewise, it is noted that even the publication on the Internet of personal data by the subject to whom they refer, for example in the context of a social media network, does not, in itself, entail a sufficient condition to justify its free reuse by third parties. If, in fact, it is true that the Regulation (and, therefore, in this case, the principle of purpose referred to in art. 5, para. 1, letter b), of the Regulation) does not apply to the processing of personal data carried out by a natural person for the exercise of activities of an exclusively personal or domestic nature (so-called household exemption, referred to in art. 2, para. 2, letter c), of the Regulation), even with reference to online activities, it is also true that the derogation must be interpreted in a restrictive sense. As sanctioned by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the derogation \"includes only activities that fall within the scope of the private or family life of individuals, which manifestly does not occur in the case of the processing of personal data consisting of their publication on the Internet in such a way as to make such data accessible to an indefinite number of people\" (see judgment 6 November 2003, case C-101/01, par. 47) It must therefore be considered that even the publication of personal data by the interested party on social networks is bound to the mere purpose for which the interested party intended to make them public (for example, visibility within a particular social network for the sole purposes underlying the use of this SNS).\nThe correctness of the thesis is supported by the Article 29 Working Group, which clarified \"that, even if they have been made accessible to the public, personal data continue to be considered such and, consequently, adequate guarantees continue to be necessary for their processing\" (cf. Opinion 6/2014 - WP217) and, more recently, by the Committee for the protection of personal data, which established that \"any communication of personal data constitutes a specific processing for which the data controller must have a legal basis among those referred to in Article 6\", that \"the transmission of footage to third parties for purposes other than those for which the data were collected is possible pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 4\" and, finally, that \"the third party recipient must carry out its own legal analysis, in particular by identifying the legal basis of its processing pursuant to Article 6\" (cf.

    "summary": "A judge from the Gelderland District Court in the Netherlands utilized ChatGPT, and cited it expressly, to determine the average lifespan of solar panels and the prevailing electricity price per kWh during a property dispute.",
    "excerpt": "\"The district court estimates, partly with the help of ChatGPT, the average lifespan of solar panels from 2009 at 25 to 30 years; that service life is therefore set at 27.5 years here. So those panels still had about 15 years to go in 20225. So over that remaining time, it is a maximum (probably decreasing) 7.5 mWh yield loss. Assuming, again on the basis of ChatGPT, a current average kWh price of € 0.30 (€ 0.29 to € 0.34, depending on the type of contract, but [claiming party in the convention] has not said anything about that)6, the loss of return, with a more or less constant kWh price, is thus about € 2,250,--. Why not join the amount of € 13,963.20 mentioned by [claiming party in the agreement] is sufficiently justified with the above and the notes 4 to 7.7”",

Even the domain names that have been registered are just being squatted upon, and there can be no reason why the same could be allowed to be squatted upon.

Whether a decision is reasonable or unreasonable will determine if it is upheld or set aside, whether or not artificial intelligence was used. To hold otherwise would elevate process over substance.” (…) [28] Regarding the use of the “Chinook” software, the Applicant suggests that there are questions about its reliability and efficacy. In this way, the Applicant suggests that a decision rendered using Chinook cannot be termed reasonable until it is elaborated to all stakeholders how machine learning has replaced human input and how it affects application outcomes.

The ministry submits that artificial intelligence is a highly competitive space and disclosure of the aggregate information about funding would unduly benefit competitors. (…) After my review of the severed information in this group of records, I am satisfied that if the information is disclosed it could harm the named organization because it contains information concerning funding commitment details and disclosure would prejudice ongoing funding negotiations and/or arrangements.\n \n\n[118]   Despite the appellant’s focus on the statements that the named organization is not competing with others in the industry, it is clear from reviewing the records that an organization is being established which requires ongoing funding. In my view, whether the organization is for, or not-for profit, in a highly competitive industry, I find that releasing the information could cause harm to the named organization. If this information is disclosed, it could clearly give others operating in this industry knowledge of which they would otherwise not have access to.\n“",

    "summary": "The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) investigated McMaster University’s use of Respondus Monitor, an AI-powered exam proctoring tool, due to concerns about biometric data collection and AI-driven decision-making. The report acknowledged that AI-based proctoring is a lawful activity but raised significant risks, including biased algorithmic flagging, potential misuse of student data for system improvement, and inadequate transparency regarding AI’s role in academic integrity assessments. The IPC recommended that McMaster secure a commitment from Respondus to cease using student data for AI training without consent, conduct an algorithmic impact assessment, allow students to opt out of AI-based proctoring, and establish stronger oversight mechanisms to mitigate AI-related harms.",
    "excerpt": " \n\n[143]   I recommend that McMaster carry out this necessary consultation step with representatives of its many diverse communities among its student population, particularly those from vulnerable or historically marginalized groups. These consultations should also include necessary experts in privacy and human rights, as well as technologists with relevant expertise to understand how the underlying algorithms work and their potential adverse or differential impacts on communities. (…) [147]   It is not within my mandate to make findings or recommendations under human rights law. However, I encourage McMaster to make special arrangements not only for students requesting formal accommodation under a protected ground in human rights legislation, but also for any other students having serious apprehensions about the AI-enabled software and the significant impacts it can have on them and their personal information.  Now that in-person invigilation is possible post COVID, all students should be provided with the general opportunity to opt out of online exam proctoring in favor of in-person exams depending on their personal circumstances and general level of comfort with this relatively invasive technology. (…) [154]   However, given the fallibility of many AI tools, I recommend that McMaster provide a less formal means for students to challenge flags identified by the Respondus Monitor software, including their instructor’s subsequent review, prior to invoking the formal academic integrity process that can be a very heavy one.  Students should be provided with a meaningful opportunity to explain their situation. Where warranted, students should have the right to correct the information, and have the flag removed and any inferences or allegations based on the flag deleted from their student record. It is possible that McMaster already provides students with this informal opportunity to explain in practice. However, I recommend that its FAQs aimed at students provide explicitly for the possibility of this informal step and communicate it in a way that is understandable and actionable for its intended audience.\n(…) [164]   On a broader level, McMaster remains accountable for the continued use of AI technologies throughout their lifecycle and across the variety of circumstances in which they are used. This includes continually evaluating the reliability of the tool. Even once a particularized agreement is in place for the use of Respondus Monitor, McMaster should continue to monitor for and alert Respondus to potential inappropriate uses or biased outcomes that may not have been disclosed as a potential limitation of their system. Conversely, McMaster should require Respondus to also monitor for, and inform the university of any weaknesses, biases or vulnerabilities it discovers about the program.\n \n\n[165]   The adoption and application of the above guardrails would allow institutions such as McMaster to make responsible use of AI technologies to help carry out its lawfully authorized activities, while protecting against discriminatory impacts and promoting students’ privacy. I acknowledge that several of McMaster's practices already demonstrate an understanding of the heightened need to protect the privacy rights of students when utilizing these types of technologies.  However, to the extent there may be gaps, I recommend McMaster adopt the additional guardrails above and build them into its online proctoring program and/or its contractual provisions with Respondus as appropriate.  \n“\n\n",

    "summary": "Nathan Duarte cited three legal cases to support his claims, but the City of Richmond argued that these cases were likely fabricated by a generative AI tool, as they could not be found in legal databases and appeared inconsistent with standard case law citation practices. The Tribunal rejected Duarte’s cited cases, cautioning against the risks of using AI-generated legal references without verification. It emphasized that parties must critically assess AI outputs to avoid submitting fabricated information.",
    "excerpt": "\"[52]           I pause here to note that Mr. Duarte provided three cases which he states stand for the position that this Tribunal has previously recognized union affiliation as a basis for protection against discrimination. Although he provides the names and years of these cases, he does not provide citations. The City says it tried to review these decisions but could not find them. I also could not find the cases in my own searches. The City offers the conclusion that the cases either do not exist or were fabricated by a generative artificial intelligence [AI] application. The City points to one example cited by Mr. Duarte: “R v. C.P. Rail (1994).” The City says the “R” suggests a criminal case, and Canada Pacific Railway is a federally-regulated organization. Further, the City says the Tribunal does not have authority over criminal or federal matters, and the Canadian Human Rights Act, which does apply to federal organizations, does not include political belief as a protected characteristic. As a result, the City says it is unlikely that any such case was decided by either this Tribunal or the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n\n[53]           While it is not necessary for me to determine if Mr. Duarte intended to mislead the Tribunal, I cannot rely on these “authorities” he cites in his submission. At the very least, Mr. Duarte has not followed the Tribunal’s Practice Direction for Legal Authorities, which requires parties, if possible, to provide a neutral citation so other participants can access a copy of the authority without cost. Still, I am compelled to issue a caution to parties who engage the assistance of generative AI technology while preparing submissions to the Tribunal, in case that is what occurred here. AI tools may have benefits. However, such applications have been known to create information, including case law, which is not derived from real or legitimate sources. It is therefore incumbent on those using AI tools to critically assess the information that it produces, including verifying the case citations for accuracy using legitimate sources. Failure to do so can have serious consequences. For lawyers, such errors have led to disciplinary action by the Law Society: see for example, Zhang v Chen, 2024 BCSC 285. Deliberate attempts to mislead the Tribunal, or even careless submission of fabricated information, could also form the basis for an award of costs under s. 37(4) of the Code.  The integrity of the Tribunal’s process, and the justice system more broadly, requires parties to exercise diligence in ensuring that their engagement with artificial intelligence does not supersede their own judgement and credibility.\n“",

    "issue": "Criminal justice",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "This case is the first in Canada to address the use of deepfake technology in the creation of child pornography. The court ruled that while the use of deepfake technology was novel, it did not alter the fundamental nature of the offence of producing child pornography. Despite the lack of evidence of distribution, the court imposed a 42-month sentence, emphasizing the ongoing harm to victims and the need for deterrence.",
    "excerpt": "\"The use of deepfake technology by criminals is chilling. This type of software makes it possible to commit crimes that could involve practically every child in our communities. A simple video excerpt of a child on social media or a surreptitious screenshot of children in a public place could transform them into potential child pornography victims. All a cybercriminal has to do is sequence the video and exchange the child’s face with the face of a sexual assault victim found online. New files are thus created and the children’s sexual and psychological image and integrity are irreparably harmed, with the potential for that file to be disseminated everywhere on the Internet, without any control.\n[71]        Production of child pornography is fueled by the market for it, and the market in turn is fueled by those who seek to possess it.[41] This market, on the lookout for anything new, is thus being fuelled by the creation of new files, be they genuine or deepfakes.\n\n[72]        It should be recalled that the harms of child pornography are known and many: child pornography promotes cognitive distortions in offenders by banalizing the awful. It fuels fantasies that incite sexual offences against children. It is used to groom and seduce victims and leads others to produce new material to fuel the market of possession[42] by assaulting and abusing real children. By producing this type of content, the offender is serving this market of cruelty to children.\n\n(…)[75]        While it is true that children were not sexually assaulted again or exploited in another way to make this new material, the fact remains that their image and their sexual integrity related to this image was again violated. However, it would be contrary to the philosophy of our criminal law (and would be an error of law) for a person to suffer a disproportionate punishment simply to send a message to discourage others from offending.[43] The court’s primary role is to impose fair punishments.[44]\n\n[76]        In this sense, using technology to make deepfake material does not substantially change the essence of the offence of making child pornography. While the case at bar is unique because of the technology used, this does not mean that it should be treated exceptionally. Whether it was made using technology to create deepfake photos or videos or using better-known technologies matters little when determining the fit sentence. Potential offenders will understand from the sentence imposed that they cannot expect any special leniency from the Court by claiming that they are [translation] “mere tinkerers” using existing images of abused children. They will face the same punishments.\n\n“",

    "summary": "The complainants bought a condo unit with unauthorized alterations and sought retroactive approval from the strata, which was denied. The tribunal rejected their claim, finding the strata’s refusal was not significantly unfair and highlighting that the applicants relied on hallucinated case law from an AI chatbot (Copilot), which misrepresented the legal framework.",
    "excerpt": "\"25.   The Geismayrs’ submissions reference ten decisions where they say courts ruled that a strata could not force the removal of strata lot alterations. These cases have the parties’ names and the years published, but no legal citation. Nine of these cases do not exist. The remaining case, “The Owners, Strata Plan LMS 2768 v. Jordison (2013)”, has three court decisions published in 2013, however, none of these are related to unauthorized alterations. The Geismayrs listed the source of these cases as a “Conversation with Copilot” which is an artificial intelligence chatbot. I find it likely that these cases are “hallucinations” where artificial intelligence generates false or misleading results.\n\n26.   The state of the law is very different than what Copilot reported. Multiple CRT decisions say that owners cannot reasonably expect retroactive approval for alterations done without the strata’s prior authorization. For recent examples, see Champoux v. The Owners, Strata Plan EPS5773, 2024 BCCRT 522, Liang v. The Owners, Strata Plan LMS 2195, 2024 BCCRT 1244, and Duck v. The Owners, Strata Plan K196, 2024 BCCRT 1300.\n\n“",

    "issue": "Legal profession",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "In R. v. Pryde, the accused chose an English-language criminal trial, but a new Quebec law required that the final written judgment be filed with a simultaneous French translation, causing delays. The Court found that the mandatory simultaneous translation under s. 10 of the Charter of the French Language would delay verdicts in English trials, violating federal language rights under the Criminal Code and interfering with judicial independence. The Court rejected the Attorney-General’s suggestion that AI translations could solve the issue, as sharing draft judgments with AI tools for pre-release translation posed serious confidentiality risks and was inappropriate. Even if AI could speed up translation, the judgment process is fluid and last-minute edits are common, making instant, secure translation unfeasible and incompatible with judicial practice.",
    "excerpt": "\"[163]     Deep in the schedules to the second affidavit, the Attorney-General’s materials allude to “translation tools” (i.e., software) and artificial intelligence that could hopefully streamline the translation process and make it quick and efficient. Software and artificial intelligence to translate the carefully chosen, carefully crafted words, expressions, terms of art and legal standards that a judge meticulously ponders during the drafting process. The language of Shakespeare might be converted to the language of Molière by way of R2D2.\n\n[164]     Of course, that is the government’s prerogative. Whether this is a good or bad idea is not for the Court to decide. Whether this will render legal translators obsolete cannot be the Court’s concern. The government is free to opine: if artificial intelligence can write simulations of Drake and Taylor Swift songs, it must be able to accurately translate legal decisions dealing with citizens’ liberty interests, right? Ultimately, this is a political decision about administrative operations. Only the electorate can determine the wisdom of this approach or otherwise criticize its appropriateness.\n\n[165]     That being said, it is important to recall that a draft-judgment, until the exact moment it is publicly filed in open court, must remain extremely confidential, privileged and protected. A draft-judgment is never to be passed around. Granted, such a document may be shared with a human, breathing legal secretary in some cases. However, the wisdom of entrusting a highly sensitive draft-judgment to software or artificial intelligence in the pre-release stage is alarming to say the least.\n\n[166]     Indeed, the same concerns apply equally to the prospect of sending unpublished, pre-release judgments to human interpreters at SOQUIJ. Such a practice would be highly inappropriate.\n\n[167]     On another note, even assuming that software or artificial intelligence will dramatically increase the speed of the translation, the process will still not be instantaneous. It is not uncommon that a judge drafts (and edits, and re-edits, and re-edits, and re-edits) his reasons until the day before their delivery. Sometimes, he makes changes until the morning of. That is the lot of judges sitting in high volume metropolitan districts.\n\n“",

    "excerpt": "\"[17] For the sake of completeness, I would note that I agree with the Appellant on this point. It would seem to me that, our age of technology and sophisticated artificial intelligence, the Commission should be able to implement a computer program or software that could conduct an initial vetting of an individual’s EI claim for parental benefits. The fact is that parents across Canada are routinely making the same mistake the Appellant has made and are accidentally applying for a type of parental benefits they are not entitled to receive. I personally have heard numerous appeals that address this same issue. Parents are also routinely making the mistake of applying to receive too many weeks of benefits over and above the 40-week combined maximum for standard parental benefits or the 69 combined week maximum for extended parental benefits. I personally have also heard numerous appeals that address this same issue. In almost all of these cases, the individuals end up accidentally receiving parental benefits they are not entitled to receive and are then compelled to re-pay the Commission sometimes thousands of dollars in overpayments. This problem is compounded because, as the Commission obviously has a heavy workload, it often does not notice these mistakes until many months or sometimes years after the individual has already received their parental benefits. The large overpayments that individuals like the Appellant face could easily be avoided if the Commission were proactively vetting applications and catching these very obvious mistakes earlier in the application process.\n\n[18] However, regardless of how articulately the Appellant voiced his concerns and regardless of my opinion on this matter, the fact remains that the Appellant chose to receive standard parental benefits that he was not entitled to receive.”",

    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "The Australian Full Federal Court ruled that an artificial intelligence system like DABUS cannot be considered an “inventor” under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) and its Regulations, overturning a prior decision that had allowed it. The Court held that the statutory language and legislative history of Australian patent law clearly assume that an inventor must be a natural person, as only a human can generate the “inventive concept” that forms the basis of patent entitlement. While acknowledging the growing role of AI in innovation, the Court emphasized that any policy change to include AI as inventors must come from legislative reform, not judicial interpretation.",
    "excerpt": "\"\tFirst, in filing the application, Dr Thaler no doubt intended to provoke debate as to the role that artificial intelligence may take within the scheme of the Patents Act and Regulations. Such debate is important and worthwhile. However, in the present case it clouded consideration of the prosaic question before the primary judge, which concerned the proper construction of s 15 and reg 3.2C(2)(aa). In our view, there are many propositions that arise for consideration in the context of artificial intelligence and inventions. They include whether, as a matter of policy, a person who is an inventor should be redefined to include an artificial intelligence. If so, to whom should a patent be granted in respect of its output? The options include one or more of: the owner of the machine upon which the artificial intelligence software runs, the developer of the artificial intelligence software, the owner of the copyright in its source code, the person who inputs the data used by the artificial intelligence to develop its output, and no doubt others. If an artificial intelligence is capable of being recognised as an inventor, should the standard of inventive step be recalibrated such that it is no longer judged by reference to the knowledge and thought processes of the hypothetical uninventive skilled worker in the field? If so, how? What continuing role might the ground of revocation for false suggestion or misrepresentation have, in circumstances where the inventor is a machine?\n\tThose questions and many more require consideration. Having regard to the agreed facts in the present case, it would appear that this should be attended to with some urgency. However, the Court must be cautious about approaching the task of statutory construction by reference to what it might regard as desirable policy, imputing that policy to the legislation, and then characterising that as the purpose of the legislation: Deal at [37]; Miller v Miller [2011] HCA 9; 242 CLR 446 at [29] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ). It would appear that this was the approach favoured by the primary judge. \n“",

Mr Robertson then contends that it is for this reason that he did not apply, online, for employment at the McDonald's Targo Street, Bundaberg 'outlet' after he noted an employment vacancy sign at that outlet. \n\tThis general complaint can only concern alleged discrimination in the pre-work area within the meaning of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991.\n\tIn terms of what seems to be an allegation of direct discrimination, Mr Robertson does not clearly contend how McDonald's treated or proposed to treat him less favourably in the pre-work area within the meaning of s 14(a)-(f) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 when in fact he did not apply for the advertised vacant position at the McDonald's outlet in Bundaberg and when McDonald's (presumably) had no knowledge of him or of his age. The allegations about this issue are vague. McDonald's is left to interpret these paragraphs to be able to discern what is actually being alleged against it.\n\tSimilarly, in terms of what seems to be an allegation of indirect discrimination, Mr Robertson does not clearly contend how McDonald's imposed or proposed to impose a term on him such that he was the subject of unlawful discrimination in the pre‑work area within the meaning of s 14(a)-(f) of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991. The alleged imposed term of 'Junior' is said to be '… clandestine, namely silent.' Mr Robertson does not clearly state how this term was imposed or proposed to be imposed on him when he did not apply for the vacant position at the McDonald's outlet in Bundaberg and when McDonald's (presumably) had no knowledge of him or of his age.

The webpage included instructions for registering online and depositing funds. A supposed user of the webpage reported that, as they navigated to the deposit page, they were contacted by an account manager.\n(…)\tIn all the circumstances, I would readily infer and conclude, from the evidence as a whole, that EuropeFX utilised, most likely through its contracts with Affilimedia, BAFF and Bolacom, online advertisements, promotions and marketing techniques which sought to attract customers using the lure of a trading program, supposedly endorsed by prominent businesspeople and celebrities, that somehow enabled users to automatically trade in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and thereby make handsome profits.  I would also infer that those advertisements, promotions and marketing strategies were misleading and deceptive.  While there was some evidence that EuropeFX may have facilitated trading in Bitcoin CFDs, the promotion identified by Mr Parry, and the promotions referred to by the witnesses and documentary evidence referred to earlier, concerned a program that involved automated Bitcoin trading.  Moreover, there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any of the celebrities referred to in the promotional material had in fact endorsed EuropeFX’s CFD and Margin FX Contract trading.  The nature and content of the material would tend to support the inference that there were no such celebrity endorsements.  The absence of any evidence from any officer, employee or agent EuropeFX concerning its promotions and marketing makes those inferences all the easier to draw.  I am not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by EuropeFX about why those inferences cannot or should not be drawn.\n“",

That review identified the fact that in the lead-up to the hearing in that Court, and continuing into the de novo hearing in this Court, the Secretary’s position was, in a material respect, based on a materially flawed premise which was then systemically perpetuated in a continuum, in a manner akin to a Kafkaesque operation of artificial intelligence in the departmental records system.\n\tThis occurred in circumstances where departmental caseworkers and managers were unable to reconsider and effectively override matters of systemically assumed child protection risks that, on the evidence that was readily available to them, ought to have been materially downgraded as to significance and likelihood of occurrence. \n“",

It also noted ClearView prevented users from exercise their rights of access and deletion. The deletion of data previously collected was also ordered. In 2022, the investigation was closed and an administrative fine of 20 million euros was issued. In a follow-up 2023 decision, as the company did not provide any proof of compliance, a penalty of 5.2 million euros was imposed (Délibération de la formation restreinte n° SAN-2023-005 du 17 avril 2023 concernant la société X). ",
    "excerpt": "\"\n(…) As part of the investigations conducted by the CNIL, the company was asked about the legal basis of this processing, within the meaning of Article 6 of the GDPR. The company did not provide any answer on this point. The company's confidentiality policy, previously mentioned, also does not mention the legal basis of said treatment.\nIt can be noted from the outset that the company has not obtained the consent of the data subjects to the processing of their personal data.\n(…) With regard to the legal basis relating to the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller, provided for in Article 6. 1. (f) of the Regulation, it should be recalled as a preliminary point of thumb that the 'publicly accessible' nature of a data does not affect the qualification of personal data and that there is no general authorization for the reuse and re-processing of publicly available personal data, in particular without the knowledge of the data subjects. (…) In the present case, even if the interest of the company were based on the economic interest which it derives from the operation of the database in question, that interest should nevertheless be balanced with the interests or the fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subjects, taking into account the reasonable expectations of the persons based on their relationship with the controller, in accordance with Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 47 and the ECDPS opinion on the concept of legitimate interest referred to above.\nIn this case, the processing is particularly intrusive: it collects a large number of photographic data on a given person, which are associated with other personal data that may reveal various aspects of privacy. From this data, a biometric template is constituted, i.e. biometric data allowing, if it is reliable, to identify the person in a unique way from a photograph of the person: the possession of such data by a third party constitutes a strong invasion of privacy. Finally, it should be noted that this treatment concerns an extremely high number of people.\nIn addition, it is necessary to determine whether the data subjects could reasonably expect, at the time and in the context of the collection of personal data, that they will be subject to such processing by company X. In this respect, there is no relationship between the company and the persons concerned. While they can reasonably expect third parties to have occasional access to the photographs in question, the publicly accessible nature of the photographs in question is not sufficient to consider that the persons concerned can reasonably expect their images to feed into facial recognition software. Finally, the software operated by the company is not public and the vast majority of the people concerned are unaware of its existence.\n“",

In this case, the restricted training notes that the collection of the Stow Machine Gun indicator amounts in practice to following the speed of succession of the employee's actions, in each of the gestures he performs on a direct task, by associating an error indicator each time this speed is less than 1.25 seconds. However, the restricted training notes that this information reveals a behavior of the employee in the way he performs his direct tasks and is likely to exercise on him a continuous monitoring of the delays associated with each of his actions on direct tasks, with a measure of the order of the second. It therefore considers that this indicator has a significant intrusive character and that its treatment is likely to have negative moral repercussions on the employee, which may result from this continuous monitoring that it allows of his activity on direct tasks. The restricted training also notes that the processing of this indicator concerns a large number of people, since it targets all employees working in its warehouses.\n\n73. Moreover, the restricted training considers that monitoring of such precision exceeds the reasonable expectations of employees who, while they can expect, as employees of the company, that their work will be subject to some monitoring, cannot reasonably expect that their actions carried out with the scanners to be monitored to the nearest second.\n\n74. Thus, the restricted training considers that the treatment of this indicator exceeds what is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the company to ensure the quality and safety in its logistics centers, since it excessively infringes the rights and interests of employees working in warehouses - in particular those to the protection of their private and personal life, as well as their right to working conditions that respect their health and safety.\n\n75.

This operation involves the processing of personal data, albeit for a very short time, necessary for the identification, by CNN, of faces and for the extraction of other relevant information.\nAlthough, therefore, the described system does not provide for a treatment of the images of the visitors' faces, aimed at biometric recognition and identification, it is undeniable that the operation of the system is based on an initial acquisition of images containing the visitors' faces, subsequently processed precisely in order to identify, within them, the faces. The frames reside on the system for a very short period, but still sufficient to implement a processing of personal data by the subjects involved (see provisionally December 21, 2017, n. 551, web doc. n. 7496252, relating to a substantially similar case, in which \"albeit for a short period of time, equal to a few tenths of a second, the system installed [by the data controller] involves [va] a processing of personal data, consisting of the images of the face of the interested parties, aimed at deduce from the image of the face a series of information used to carry out analysis of the advertising audience”).”",

It also noted the legal basis for training the GPT models was not adequately identified. It fined OpenAI in 15 million euros and ordered the company to carry out an institutional communication campaign, lasting for six months, to promote public awareness regarding the operation of the ChatGPT service and its implications to personal data. The contents of the communication had to be approved by the Guarantor.",
    "excerpt": "\"In the present case, the Guarantor noted that the authority has not received any notification of the data breach that occurred on March 20, 2023, despite the involvement of Italian interested parties and the existence of its competence pursuant to art. 55 of the Regulation, considering the inapplicability of articles 56 et sex. of the Regulation not existing, at the time of the facts, a single or main establishment of the Company in the European Union. It should be added that from the communication made by the Company, pursuant to art. 34 of the Regulation, to the interested parties involved in the data breach it is possible to deduce an admission of the Company itself regarding the assessment of the high risk related to the event.\n(…) In this case, the Guarantor found that the processing of personal data by OpenAI for the purposes of training the GPT language model underlying the operation of the ChatGPT service occurred well before the same service was made available to the public on November 30, 2022 (see https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt). At least on that date, but also reasonably also in an earlier period, therefore, OpenAI should have identified a legal basis on which to base the processing for model training. From the documentation in the acts, however, there is no element from which to deruce the evidence that the Company has identified a legal basis at a time prior to the start of the processing, in particular at the time of the collection of data from the Internet for the training of the ChatGPT LLM. This assumption is also reinforced by the absence of any indication of the legal basis in the information provided to the interested parties.

The campaign should be aimed at promoting the understanding and awareness of the public regarding the operation of the ChatGPT service, the implications of the same with respect to the right to the protection of personal data, with reference to the collection of data from users and non-users for the purpose of training models and the rights they can exercise under the Regulation, with specific reference to the right of the interested parties to exercise the right of opposition and the right of cancellation of personal data;”\n",

The petitioner claims that excessive use of digital and AI technologies to manipulate the image of electoral candidates misleads voters, impeding their constitutional right to access truthful information and undermining the fairness of elections. The Court reasoned that without regulation, AI-manipulated campaign imagery could distort voter perception, compromise informed decision-making, and erode the integrity of democratic processes, imposing restrictions on the use of AI-generated images in the elections.",
    "excerpt": "\"That the sophistication of technology applied in campaign materials needs to be limited and given strict rules because it risks distorting the facts of the candidate's true self-image and can make the election contest merely an image-building competition that has no relevance to the vision - mission and ability of the participants to lead the position being contested. The masking of reality also risks making voters unable to distinguish between the true self-image of the Election Participants and the self-image that is merely engineered/fabricated. Furthermore, the use of self-images that do not correspond to the actual facts risks deceiving voters about the true self-image of the Election Participants.\"",

    "excerpt": "\"          23) Que finalmente, más allá de que los fundamentos de la petición de la actora no alcancen para justificar el bloqueo de vínculos referidos a información de interés público, los planteos que ha efectuado, así como los temas debatidos en la audiencia pública vinculados con los criterios que utilizan los motores de búsqueda para determinar sus resultados –tales como el número de veces que las palabras-clave aparecen en el sitio, el lugar en el que aparecen, el título y la calidad del sitio, la cantidad de sitios que abrevan en tal lugar, el orden en el que los contenidos se presentan, entre otros factores− no pueden ser ignorados. Es así que el presente pronunciamiento no implica desconocer que el creciente uso de herramientas de tecnología informática y, en particular, de sistemas que podrían incluirse dentro de la categoría “Inteligencia Artificial” (IA), suscita numerosos interrogantes respecto de su campo de aplicación a la luz de los derechos fundamentales reconocidos en la Constitución Nacional y en los Tratados de Derechos Humanos, así como respecto de su incidencia en la ordenación del debate público. Aun cuando el tema no haya sido objeto de debate en la presente causa, cabe destacar la existencia de un foro de discusión mundial acerca del modo de compatibilizar los problemas que en algunas ocasiones podrían suscitarse entre los mencionados derechos y el funcionamiento de los sistemas de algoritmos (como ejemplo de los temas en debate en la materia, puede consultarse las “Directrices Éticas para una IA fiable”, Grupo Independiente de Expertos de Alto Nivel sobre Inteligencia Artificial creado por la Comisión Europea en junio de 2018)”. En este marco, y específicamente referido a los criterios de ordenamiento de la información por parte de los buscadores, la representación de la demandada sostuvo en la audiencia que el modo en que el algoritmo ordena los resultados “no necesariamente sigue una cronología. Sale lo que Google estima que es más relevante para ese usuario. Aparte es distinto si uno lo busca en Argentina, si lo busca en Estados Unidos, porque lo relevante va a ser distinto. […] Es una cosa complejísima (…)”. Posteriormente agregó que no era ese un criterio “neutro” (respuesta del Doctor Grondona p. 46 y 50 de la versión taquigráfica de la audiencia).  En base a la forma en que Google manifestó que aparecen los resultados, se podría generar un cierto perfil de las personas que podría condicionar la composición de lugar que el internauta se hará de la identidad de la persona auscultada. De ahí la necesidad de asumir hacia el futuro la problemática de ciertos aspectos del funcionamiento de los algoritmos de los que se sirven los motores de búsqueda, para que resulten más entendibles y transparentes para los usuarios, hoy sujetos a la decisión de aquellos.”\n",

    "issue": "Financial markets",
    "finalDecision": "Yes",
    "summary": "Cryptocurrency trades were executed automatically by deterministic algorithms after Quoine’s platform malfunctioned, causing trades at extreme prices without human intervention or contemporaneous knowledge by the traders. The court ruled that when contracts are formed through algorithmic trading, the relevant knowledge for unilateral mistake must be assessed based on the programmers’ intent at the time of programming and up to contract formation. Since B2C2’s programmer did not foresee or intend to exploit counterparties’ mistakes, there was no operative unilateral mistake or unconscionability, and the contracts remained valid.",
    "excerpt": "\"97 This was also the view of the Judge and it drove him, in our judgment, inevitably, to adopt a certain analytical model when considering the issue of unilateral mistake. Specifically, he refused to consider the matter by reference to what the position would have been and what the contracting parties were likely to have known, intended and agreed had they had face-to-face negotiations at a hypothetical meeting on the “floor of the exchange” to enter into the Trading Contracts, at the time these were entered into, because this was simply not how they had agreed to form their contracts. Instead, they had decided to form contracts using the relevant deterministic algorithms (see Judgment at [200] and [204]). We agree with this characterisation of the parties’ method of contracting and we think it would be wholly artificial to recast the relevant matrix of fact, which was one where the contracting parties did not in fact know beforehand that they were going to enter into the Trading Contracts or their terms, and were content to abide by what the relevant algorithms did at least as long as this was within the ambit of their programmed parameters. We also agree with the Judge that it follows from this that in cases where contracts are made by way of deterministic algorithms, any analysis concerning knowledge of a mistake or unconscionably taking advantage of one must be done by reference to the state of mind of the programmers of the algorithms at the time of the programming (see Judgment at [211]).\n98 As we have noted at [15] above, a deterministic computer program or algorithm is bound by the parameters set by the programmer, and can (and generally will) only do what the programmer has programmed it to do. Given a particular input, it will produce a particular output; on each occasion, the output should and will be the same if the former does not change. Therefore, when it comes to assessing the state of knowledge that is to be attributed to the parties at the time of a contract made by way of deterministic algorithms, the relevant inquiry cannot be directed at the parties themselves, who had no knowledge of or direct personal involvement in the formation of the contract. Rather, working backwards from the output that emanated from the programs, we are driven to assess the relevant state of knowledge by examining that of the programmers. This approach is consistent with that which was advocated by Prof Goh.\n99 Apart from determining whose knowledge is relevant, it is also important to consider the relevant time for assessing that person’s knowledge. In our judgment, the relevant time frame within which we should assess the knowledge of a programmer or the person running the algorithm would be from the point of programming up to the point that the relevant contract is formed. As Prof Goh noted, the point of programming is when the programmer’s knowledge is the most concretised. The question can first be framed in this way: if the algorithm was programmed to produce a particular output, why was this done? But the inquiry cannot end there and must extend past that point of time because there may be situations where a programmer or the person running the algorithm who did not contemplate the relevant mistake at the point of programming came to learn of it subsequently before the contract had been formed, and yet allowed the algorithm to continue running, intending thereby to take advantage of the mistake. In such a case, it would be wrong to ignore the subsequent acquisition of knowledge. This is why it is appropriate to have regard to the state of knowledge up to the time of the contract.\n“",

    "summary": "The decision notes that platforms like Uber do not have autonomous will comparable to human decision-making, at least at the current stage of AI development.\nTherefore, the analysis of the relationship must focus on the real execution of the work rather than on the platform’s formal role or contractual labels.",
    "excerpt": "\"En concreto, la parte demandada invoca al apelar como distingo que fue el actor quien “ buscó contratar a UBER”, argumento que carece de toda relevancia, no es relevante quien “buscara” se ha de inferir que invocándose por la demandada que lo relevante es la plataforma, las plataformas no “buscan” a nadie están disponibles y determinados sujetos se vinculan con las empresas titulares de las plataformas, las plataformas no son personas jurídicas y no tienen voluntad propia, equiparable a los procesos de decisión humanos, al menos en el actual estadio del desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial. Lo que se ofrece por la demandada a través de la plataforma es un contrato de adhesión. Por lo tanto en ello reside lo que resulta relevante jurídicamente, en la forma y contenido del contrato. A las pautas ya referidas señaladas por la doctrina, solo cabe agregar que en punto a analizar la modalidad de vinculación resulta relevante tomar en cuenta si el modo de contratación en la cual el sujeto que presta trabajo carece de toda posibilidad de incidencia o negociación, por el mecanismo utilizado de acuerdo mediante “clic” a una forma pre redactada y de autoría unilateral de la demandada, ofrece respecto de la actividad, trabajo humano prestado por quien adhiere alguna ventaja concreta respecto de otras modalidades típicas para la prestación de la misma tarea. Es decir cabe preguntarse qué beneficio obtendría quien opta por adherir a la forma ofrecida por UBER. Nótese que UBER no paga ninguno de los costos que el conductor se obliga a asumir, no efectúa inversión alguna, y no paga beneficios sociales correspondientes a los trabajadores. Pero percibe un porcentaje que la propia demandada admite que se ubique en aproximadamente un 30% del producido bruto del trabajo del actor. Paralelamente, lo que resulta medular no es la denominación que las partes, en el caso la parte demandada y por simple adhesión la parte que presta trabajo, sino la realidad de lo actuado por las partes en la etapa de ejecución de la prestación de trabajo. Ello incluso desde la perspectiva del Código Civil, artículo 1301. Dadas las restricciones que desde la realidad se observan a la autonomía de la voluntad, desde la perspectiva ya señalada, dicha limitación no requiere para operar que se invoque un vicio del consentimiento, sino que proviene de la misma realidad y contexto en que se vinculan los sujetos prestador de trabajo y quien obtiene un beneficio directo de dicho trabajo. Circunstancia que en el caso aparece aun más reafirmada por tratarse el contrato que vinculó a las partes de uno de adhesión, en el cual el margen de negociación es prácticamente inexistente. Por lo tanto adquiere significación la regla del comportamiento de los contratantes con posterioridad al otorgamiento del contrato. Dicho de otro modo procede analizar las condiciones estipuladas en el contrato de adhesión y la ejecución posterior del referido contrato a los efectos debatidos en autos. Lo actuado objetiva la realidad más allá de las formas del contrato se trata de un elemento no textual a considerar. La parte recurrente menciona el uso de aplicaciones equiparando la situación de UBER con otras plataformas como Netflix sin tomar en cuenta la especificidad de la vinculación entre UBER y el conductor actor que implico prestación de trabajo humano a cambio de un pago dinerario que UBER efectuaba al actor, por la vía de cobrar el monto del precio del traslado al cliente directamente para retener la parte que a priori había determinado le correspondía y solo después abonar al actor lo restante del producido de su trabajo. Lo que en modo alguno se equipara a plataformas como Netflix en que solo se adquiere un determinado producto por un consumidor. Mencionar el uso común de plataformas en la vida cotidiana sin deslindar resulta en una generalización inocua. “",

    "summary": "A judge used ChatGPT 3.5 during the drafting of a decision, raising concerns about potential violations of due process. The Constitutional Court found no violation because the judge made and motivated the decision, but emphasized the need for transparency, responsibility, and future guidelines to regulate AI use in judicial proceedings. It also noted decisions taken by AI itself will be deemed void.",
    "excerpt": "\"219.        De acuerdo con nuestro ordenamiento jurídico, el juez natural tiene que ser un humano y no una máquina, por lo que la IA no puede suplantar al juez en la toma de decisiones judiciales, pues ello implicaría la violación de la garantía del juez legal previamente establecido, sin importar la complejidad del asunto sometido a estudio de la jurisdicción. Si la decisión judicial es tomada por una IA, sin valoración y determinación por parte de un juez, será invalida y se quebrantará el derecho fundamental al debido proceso.\n \n220.        Visto lo anterior, la Sala de Revisión concluye que se genera una violación de la garantía del juez natural cuando el funcionario judicial utiliza la IA para sustituir el razonamiento lógico y humano que le compete realizar a efectos de interpretar los hechos, las pruebas, motivar la decisión e incluso adoptarla. En tales eventos habrá una sustitución del poder jurisdiccional por cuenta de la IA y con ello, la configuración de una violación al debido proceso por violación de la garantía de un juez legal previamente establecido.\n \n221.        Por el contrario, el uso de la IA en el sistema judicial para los ámbitos de gestión administrativa y documental, así como el de apoyo a la gestión judicial y la corrección y síntesis de largos textos, no comporta una transgresión a la garantía del juez natural pues, en tales eventos, la utilización de estas tecnologías no remplaza la labor esencial que se le ha atribuido al funcionario judicial, consistente en conocer y resolver de fondo el asunto para el cual fue investido de competencia. Lo anterior se cumple, siempre y cuando no se involucre una labor de creación de contenido ni interpretación de hechos o pruebas y, mucho menos, la solución de casos, y siempre y cuando haya una supervisión posterior por parte de algún funcionario o empleado de la Rama Judicial.\n \n222.        De esta forma, es de especial importancia que cuando el juez natural haga uso de herramientas de IA, para las funciones anteriormente definidas, se cumpla con los criterios de (i) responsabilidad, (ii) guarda del principio de legalidad y (iii) idoneidad. Además, no sobra advertir que tratándose de una materia que se caracteriza por un desarrollo permanente y veloz, la pertinencia de estas consideraciones debe valorarse en el tiempo, según la evolución que se produzca en los ámbitos de regulación normativa y, por supuesto, en el tecnológico.”\n",

    "summary": "The Colombian Constitutional Court reviewed whether denying access to the CoronApp application’s source code violated the fundamental right to public information access, considering the app used AI-based decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Court held that although transparency in AI systems used by the State is essential to protect citizens’ rights, the agency failed to properly justify the denial under the strict legal exceptions, particularly because concerns about copyright and public health risks did not meet the statutory thresholds to restrict access.",
    "excerpt": "\"73.             Como lo mencionaron algunos de los intervinientes en este proceso, varios Estados que decidieron utilizar tecnologías de inteligencia artificial para manejar el contagio del virus tomaron medidas de transparencia como publicar los códigos fuente de las aplicaciones o “abrirlos” para que otros pudieran modificarlos, mejorarlos y aprovecharlos para hacer su propio rastreo de contactos. Así, por ejemplo, lo hizo Alemania con la aplicación Corona-Warn-App y la India con Covid 19 Aarogya Setu. Los gobiernos de Bélgica, Eslovenia y Chipre se basaron en el código abierto de Alemania para construir sus propias aplicaciones, y también mantuvieron el código fuente abierto. Los gobiernos de Australia y Nueva Zelanda utilizaron un código abierto desarrollado por el gobierno de Singapur para crear sus propias aplicaciones, que mantuvieron con licencias abiertas[106]. Los gobiernos de Brasil y Ecuador también publicaron los códigos fuente de las aplicaciones de rastreo de contactos. En España, aunque en un principio no se publicó el código fuente de la app Radar Covid, más adelante se publicó tras la presión de la sociedad civil. En efecto, ella hizo un llamado de transparencia para garantizar un escrutinio multidisciplinar a través del cual se pudieran “identificar de forma eficiente sesgos potenciales y errores en la conceptualización e implementación de la aplicación que puedan dar lugar a efectos indeseados en términos de discriminación y vulneración de derechos”[107].\n(…) 92.             Así pues, si bien en algunas circunstancias la afectación de otros derechos, intereses y principios, como la seguridad nacional, los datos personales o la propiedad intelectual, pueden llevar a que se niegue el acceso a elementos específicos del sistema, como el código fuente, esto no debe traducirse en una negación del derecho de acceso a la información pública, pues el Estado puede adoptar medidas que maximicen la protección de los derechos en tensión. Así, por ejemplo, previo a la remisión de la información solicitada, el Estado puede requerir que el ciudadano solicitante suscriba un formato de responsabilidad en el que se comprometa de manera clara y expresa a no utilizar la información con fines comerciales y de lucro bajo el riesgo de percibir las sanciones legales y penales por la infracción de los derechos de autor. Incluso, como una regla de trazabilidad para mantener el registro de las personas que tengan acceso al código fuente, es posible que se imponga un deber de informar al sujeto obligado, en los términos de la Ley 1712 de 2014, si el algoritmo será compartido con un tercero y con qué fines.\n \n93.             En todo caso, la Corte considera de la mayor importancia que cuando las entidades públicas o que prestan servicios públicos vayan a utilizar sistemas de toma automatizada de decisiones, o de algún tipo de inteligencia artificial, se tenga en cuenta la transparencia desde el diseño de la herramienta. Así, desde un principio estaría claro cuáles serían los riesgos de compartir determinada información y cómo se podrían minimizar, sin llevar a la opacidad. Como señaló la Corte al estudiar el uso de inteligencia artificial en la administración de justicia, es necesario que el Estado priorice herramientas que permitan materializar el mandato de transparencia en la utilización de estas tecnologías, por sobre aquellas que no permitan conocer con certeza y claridad su forma de funcionamiento.”\n",

    "summary": "The Court noted that technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning now allow massive analysis of surveillance videos and their metadata, enabling automated facial recognition and behavioral predictions without human supervision. Because the norm allowed broad and undefined police access to private surveillance footage for “prevention” purposes, the Court found that this, combined with AI technologies, posed severe risks to privacy and data protection, undermining constitutional guarantees.",
    "excerpt": "\"283.        Nótese que acá no se está hablando, únicamente, de horas y horas de video, sino de todos los “metadatos” que están vinculados a esas imágenes. Entonces, otorgarle esa potestad a la Policía Nacional para fines de “prevención” significa darle una herramienta que la convierte en un ente de vigilancia y control “panóptico”, como lo señalaron algunos de los intervinientes[397]. Con el fin de entender mejor este riesgo, la Sala encuentra que es importante insistir en la necesidad de comprender el contexto en el que se insertan las cámaras de video y sus “metadatos” y observar que estos interfieren de manera profunda en el ejercicio de los derechos fundamentales a la intimidad y al hábeas data.\n \n284.        Hasta hace relativamente poco se consideraba que un video o una fotografía era algo que simplemente se “veía”, se “observaba”, y que, en consecuencia, era necesario un individuo o grupo de personas para su interpretación, análisis y uso. Sin embargo, hoy el mundo de la información y la tecnología están enmarcados por conceptos como inteligencia artificial, big data, machine learning y algoritmos[398]. Por big data se entiende una inmensa cantidad de datos, estructurados y no estructurados, que ofrecen información de todo tipo. Por ejemplo, en el contexto comercial, estos datos pueden dar información sobre los hábitos de compra que tiene una persona lo que, a su vez, puede servir para saber qué tipo de publicidad se le debe enviar a sus redes sociales. El análisis del big data permite identificar problemas, tendencias y patrones.\n \n285.        Como la cantidad de información es tan voluminosa, es muy difícil que un humano ejecute esta tarea. Aquí es donde entra el denominado machine learning. Esta es una rama de la inteligencia artificial que, valiéndose de programas y software especializado, puede analizar toda esa información para identificar patrones y realizar predicciones. Esto permite que los computadores realicen este proceso de manera autónoma. Por supuesto, la Sala reconoce que estas nociones son más técnicas, pero lo dicho revela dos realidades: hay una gran cantidad de información sobre las personas obtenida en espacios en donde se instalan circuitos cerrados de vigilancia y seguridad y existe la tecnología para analizar todos esos datos.\n(…) 288.        Si además de lo expuesto se tiene en cuenta el desarrollo que hay en inteligencia artificial, puede anticiparse el riesgo que implica que la norma acusada otorgue a la Policía Nacional la facultad de acceder a circuitos cerrados de vigilancia y seguridad privados “para acciones de prevención”. No hay que olvidar que esta autoridad podría acceder, potencialmente, no solo al video, sino a todos los datos asociados con éste (hora, lugar, etc.). Con los medios económicos y tecnológicos adecuados, se estaría habilitando a la mencionada autoridad para ejercer facultades para las que, incluso, podría no estar conceptual, técnica y jurídicamente preparada.\n“",

Courts are not robots: even robots of this day use artificial intelligence to do things! Courts are not rubber stamps of parties’ ill and malpractices in society. They cannot sit and see an injustice being perpetrated through them and they do nothing just because our legal system is that of common law where they must sit passively and make decisions afterwards. It is the duty of the court to do justice. While the court, should not descend into the arena of the parties and actively lead them in the manner they conduct their matter, they should, under duty and law, ensure that the rules of the “game” are level and even. They cannot close their eyes to technicalities being used to perpetrate an injustice, otherwise that would be a mockery of the law and justice. Thus, it should be clear to the plaintiff herein that service of the summons to enter appearance or the hearing notice herein is not a choice for him to make, and it is not a technicality such that he acts as though Article 159 of the Constitution will ever come to his aid.

    "excerpt": "\"exists.\nSpecifically, the testimony revealed that Mr. Ranson relied on Microsoft Copilot, a large language model generative artificial intelligence chatbot, in cross-checking his calculations. Despite his reliance on artificial intelligence, Mr. Ranson could not recall what input or prompt he used to assist him with the Supplemental Damages Report. He also could not state what sources Copilot relied upon and could not explain any details about how Copilot works or how it arrives at a given output. There was no testimony on whether these Copilot calculations considered any fund fees or tax implications.\nThe Court has no objective understanding as to how Copilot works, and none was elicited as part of the testimony. To illustrate the concern with this, the Court entered the following prompt into Microsoft Copilot on its Unified Court System (UCS) issued computer: \"Can you calculate the value of $250,000 invested in the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund from December 31, 2004 through January 31, 2021?\" and it returned a value of $949,070.97 — a number different than Mr. Ranson's. Upon running this same query on two (2) additional UCS computers, it returned values of $948,209.63 and a little more than $951,000.00, respectively. While these resulting variations are not large, the fact there are variations at all calls into question the [*12]reliability and accuracy of Copilot to generate evidence to be relied upon in a court proceeding.\nInterestingly, when asked the following question: \"are you accurate\", Copilot generated the following answer: \"I aim to be accurate within the data I've been trained on and the information I can find for you. That said, my accuracy is only as good as my sources [FN25] so for critical matters, it's always wise to verify.\nWhen asked \"are you reliable\", Copilot responded with: \"[y]ou bet. When it comes to providing information and engaging in conversation, I do my best to be as reliable as possible. However, I'm also programmed to advise checking with experts for critical issues. Always good to have a second opinion!\" When the follow-up question of \"are your calculations reliable enough for use in court\" was asked, Copilot responded with \"[w]hen it comes to legal matters, any calculations or data need to meet strict standards. I can provide accurate info, but it should always be verified by experts and accompanied by professional evaluations before being used in court . . . \"\nIt would seem that even Copilot itself self-checks and relies on human oversight and analysis. It is clear from these responses that the developers of the Copilot program recognize the need for its supervision by a trained human operator to verify the accuracy of the submitted information as well as the output.”",

There are multiple cases named Williams v.

Other cases cited in Williams’s brief present similar issues. The\n\nuse of these nonexistent citations dramatically weakens Williams’s opposition to Capital One’s\n\nmotion to dismiss because he fails to cite to supporting authority.\n\n       It is not acceptable for parties to submit filings to the Court containing citations to legal\n\nauthority that does not exist, whether drafted with the assistance of artificial intelligence or not.\n\nSee Park, 91 F.4th at 616 (referring attorney for investigation for drafting her brief by relying on\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\nChatGPT, an artificial intelligence tool); Ruggierlo, 2023 WL 5846798, at n.5 (warning a pro se\n\ndefendant that using generative artificial intelligence to create citations may result in court-\n\nimposed sanctions and wasted the court’s, the opposing party’s, and defendant’s own resources);\n\nAnonymous, 2024 WL 3460049, at *7 (warning a pro se plaintiff that citations generated by\n\nartificial intelligence are unreliable, and that citation to nonexistent legal authority is\n\nunacceptable).

Contrary to plaintiff s argument, this allegation is not unique — at least five other related actions assert similar, if not identical, consumer fraud claims on behalf of putative nationwide classes.2 One of these, the Poyet action pending in the Central District of California, like Russell asserts only consumer fraud claims based on the false user profiles. Additionally; plaintiffs learned of this alleged fraudulent scheme through analysis of the data disclosed in the Ashley Madison data breach. Thus; Russell likely will involve common factual questions regarding the data breach and the operation of the Ashley Madison website. In any event, transfer under Section 1407 does not require a -complete identity or even a majority of common factual issues as a prerequisite to transfer. See In re National Sec. Agency Telecomms. Records Litig., 444 F.Supp.2d 1332, 1334 (J.P.M.L. 2006). To the extent that Russell involves unique issues, the transferee judge has the discretion to handle those issues through the use of appropriate pretrial devices, such as separate-tracks for discovery and motion practice. -“",

Neste sentido, a determinação de reintegração da motorista à plataforma, diante das excepcionalidades do caso concreto, seria medida razoável. No entanto, já houve a reintegração e a perda de objeto neste ponto.Quanto aos danos materiais e morais, contudo, sua suposta incidência vem pautada na alegação de suspensão indevida, o que não se deu no caso, uma vez que a própria motorista deixou de observar os critérios que possibilitariam o reconhecimento facial pelo sistema de inteligência artificial.Frise-se que, decorrido mais de um ano de pandemia na ocasião do incidente, já estava o cidadão comum habituado ao uso de máscara e à necessidade de breve retirada para a realização de verificação facial em sistemas de segurança de aplicativos, celulares e câmeras de segurança, de modo que devem ser improcedentes os pedidos para condenação ao pagamento de danos morais e lucros cessantes\"",

(...) Assim, no caso, ao tempo em que deve ser resgardado o direito dos usuários de se manifestarem livremente quanto ao suposto crime praticado pelo agravante, considero que a replicação, disseminação, viralização do conteúdo publicado por um universo incontrolável de pessoas que não têm qualquer relação com a opinião originalmente emitida representa indevida extrapolação da liberdade de expressão e, como tal, abuso de direito, passível de censura judicial.\"",

    "summary": "In Ross v. United States, the D.C. Court of Appeals considered whether leaving a dog in a car on a 98°F day constituted animal cruelty, with AI tools like ChatGPT cited by both majority and dissent in arguments over what constitutes “common knowledge.”",
    "excerpt": "\"We, like the dissent, harbor doubts about whether ChatGPT is “a good proxy\nfor what is, and what isn’t, common knowledge.” Post at 37 n.4. But to the extent\nthe dissent relies on ChatGPT’s degree of certainty as to whether leaving a dog in a\nhot car is harmful, we note that ChatGPT expresses similar certainty in its response\nto the query, “How much would a pretty clean, operable 2002 Dodge Intrepid with\nno significant dents or scratches have been worth in 2012?”:\n             In 2012, a 2002 Dodge Intrepid in pretty clean, operable\n             condition with no significant dents or scratches would\n             have likely been worth between $3,000 and $5,000.\n             The exact price would have depended on factors such as\n             mileage, location, and the specific condition of the car\n             (interior, mechanical health, etc.). For instance, a lower-\n             mileage model with a well-maintained engine could have\n             been closer to the higher end of that range, while a higher-\n             mileage model might have been valued closer to the lower\n             end. Generally, as a mid-size sedan from 2002, it would\n             not have been fetching a premium price by 2012, but it still\n             had decent value as an affordable used car.\nNote that $3,000 (ChatGPT’s minimum price) is significantly above the $1,000\nthreshold at issue in Long. ChatGPT’s analysis, therefore, does not correspond to at\nleast one of our sufficiency decisions.\n“",

    "excerpt": "\"m This threat is further elevated in a search of Facebook data because, perhaps more than any other location-including a residence, a computer hard drive, or a car-Facebook provides a single window through which almost every detail of a person's life is visible.5 Indeed, Facebook is designed to replicate, record, and facilitate personal, familial, social, professional, and financial activity and networks. Users not only voluntarily entrust information concerning just about every aspect of their lives to the service, but Facebook also proactively collects and aggregates information about its users and non-users in ways that we are only just beginning to understand. See, e.g., Josh Constine, Facebook's new Study app pays adults for data after teen scandal, TECHCRUNCH , June 11, 2019, https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/study-from-facebook/ (describing various apps Facebook has built and launched that, once installed, send all the data on a person's phone to Facebook); Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users, BLOOMBERG , Apr. 11, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/zuckerberg-says-facebook-collects-internet-data-on-non-users (describing Facebook's practice of tracking nonusers' internet activity); Natasha Singer, What You Don't Know About How Facebook Uses Your Data, N.Y.

(See also Aff. ¶ 27 (explaining that \"Facebook also provides its users with access to thousands of other applications ('apps') on the Facebook platform\")). Particularly troubling, information stored in non-Facebook applications may come to constitute part of a user's \"Facebook account\"-and thus be subject to broad searches-by virtue of corporate decisions, such as mergers and integrations, without the act or awareness of any particular user. See Alex Hern, EU data watchdog raises concerns over Facebook integration, THE GUARDIAN , Jan. 28, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/28/eu-data-watchdog-raises-concerns-facebook-integration (discussing privacy concerns arising from Facebook's plans to merge three messaging networks that it owns-Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram). It is thus hard to imagine many searches more invasive than a search of all the data associated with a Facebook account. Cf. Riley, 573 U.S. at 394, 134 S.Ct. 2473 (\"The sum of an individual's private life can be reconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions.\").\nThe Second Circuit has cautioned that \"[b]ecause of the nature of digital storage, it is not always feasible to 'extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive data.' “\"",

We accept as true the\nfollowing factual allegations gleaned from the two com-\nplaints filed against Wynndalco.\n    Clearview AI allegedly has extracted or “scraped” in ex-\ncess of three billion photographs of individuals from online\nsocial media, content-sharing, and digital payment platforms\n(including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat,\nYouTube, Google Photos, LinkedIn, and Venmo); converted\nthose images into biometric facial recognition identifiers us-\ning proprietary algorithms; collected the original images and\ntheir biometric counterparts into its database; and paired\nthose images with information as to where those images were\nfound on the Internet. Clearview AI has also created a facial\nrecognition application or “app” that allows a user to identify\nan individual by uploading a photograph of that person to the\napp. The app then allows the user to see other photographs of\n4                                                     No. 22-2313\n\nthat same person on the media platforms or websites where\nthey appear, along with the identifying information (includ-\ning their name, address, and other personal information) as-\nsociated with that individual. Thus, a user could take a pho-\ntograph of a stranger on the street and upload the image to\nthe app, which converts the photograph into a biometric facial\nscan, and (assuming the individual’s photos and information\nare in Clearview AI’s database), determine who that person\nis, and access any number of additional photographs of and\nassociated content (tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts,\nYouTube and TikTok videos, LinkedIn profiles, etc.) created\nby and about that individual. Clearview AI marketed the app\nto law enforcement agencies, among others. See Kashmir Hill,\nThe Secretive Company That Might End Privacy As We Know It,\nNEW YORK TIMES (Jan. 18, 2020), available at https://www.ny-\ntimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-\nrecognition.html?.\n   The Chicago Police Department, through its purchasing\nagent CDW-Government, gained access to the Clearview AI\ndatabase and its facial-identification app by means of a two-\nyear contract between CDW-Government and Wynndalco.\n“",

The Court clarified that informed consent does not require technical mastery of the algorithm by the data subject. Instead, consent is valid if the algorithmic logic, purposes, and variables used are explained in an intelligible, unambiguous manner, sufficient for a non-technical user to understand the essence of the processing. The Court found that the association provided this level of transparency, including public documentation and a patent that described the algorithm’s operation.

    "excerpt": "\"25.   I agree with Hung Long that there are two extraordinary circumstances here that justify compensation for its time. The first is Ms. Simpson’s use of artificial intelligence. It takes little time to have a large language model create lengthy submissions with many case citations. It takes considerably more effort for the other party to wade through those submissions to determine which cases are real, and for those that are, whether they actually say what Ms. Simpson purported they did. Hung Long’s owner clearly struggled to understand Ms. Simpson’s submissions, and his legal research to try to understand them was an utter waste of his time. I reiterate my point above that Ms. Simpson’s submissions cited a non-existent case in support of a legal position that is the precise opposite of the existing law. This underscores the impact on Hung Long. How can a self-represented party respond to a seemingly convincing legal argument that is based on a case it is impossible to find?\n\n26.   I am mindful that Ms. Simpson is not a lawyer and that legal research is challenging. That said, she is responsible for the information she provides the CRT. I find it manifestly unfair that the burden of Ms. Simpson’s use of artificial intelligence should fall to Hung Long’s owner, who tried his best to understand submissions that were not capable of being understood. While I accept that Ms. Simpson did not knowingly provide fake cases or misleading submissions, she was reckless about their accuracy. I note that the BC Supreme Court required a lawyer to personally compensate another lawyer for their wasted time from trying to find non-existent cases from artificially generated submissions.[4] While Ms. Simpson does not have the same professional obligations that a lawyer has, she still has an obligation as a CRT participant not to provide misleading information.”",

A Resolução TSE nº 23.610/2019, alterada pela Resolução TSE nº 23.732/2024, veda expressamente a utilização de conteúdos manipulados ou sabidamente inverídicos na propaganda eleitoral, conforme previsto nos arts. 9–A e 9–C. 8. O conteúdo divulgado pelo recorrente utilizou inteligência artificial para produzir mensagem sabidamente inverídica, atentando contra a honra dos candidatos adversários e ultrapassando os limites do debate político legítimo. 9. O material analisado configura abuso do direito à liberdade de expressão, sendo corroborado pela reincidência do recorrente em práticas semelhantes, conforme destacado nos autos. 10. A jurisprudência do TSE tem reiterado que a divulgação de fake news desequilibra a disputa eleitoral e prejudica a integridade do pleito, legitimando a imposição de sanções previstas na legislação eleitoral, como no art. 57–D da Lei nº 9.504/1997. 11.

    "summary": "A tech firm (Reface Technologies) sued an IT company (Business-Analytica) for unauthorized commercial use of a deepfake video featuring actor Keanu Reeves. The deepfake video had been created by a media studio for Reface, which owned exclusive rights. Business-Analytica argued that no copyright subsisted in the video since it was produced with AI (face-swapping deepfake technology). The Moscow court disagreed – ruling that AI was merely a tool in the editing process, not a substitute for human creativity, and that the video was a protected work authored by the humans who scripted, filmed and produced it. The court awarded Reface 500,000 RUB in damages. The judgment was upheld on appeal and finally confirmed by the IP Court, which in August 2024 rejected the defendant’s cassation appeal",
